# Star Wars App

This was a short project I did to learn the basics of React Native. The app fetches data from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.co). The API includes data on the planets, spaceships, vehicles, people, and species from all 7 Star Wars Films. 

This app fetches information about the planets and their relevant details. 

The original Expo Snack can be found at: https://snack.expo.io/@samuelgxu/star-wars

The app was originally written in Expo. Expo (Snack) is open source and you can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack-web).
